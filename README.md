# C++ JSON Example (nlohmann)

Trivial example of a more advanced JSON structure derived completely from struct definitions using the provided derivation macros.
I couldn't find anything for nested structs and similar buffoonery so decided to take it into my own hands.

## Building
Very convoluted process. Follow instructions below carefully:
```bash
cmake -B build # feel free to use your generator of choice
cmake --build build
```

## Future
Will probably make it more complicated as I discover more.
